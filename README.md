SQL-based analysis

##Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analyis is to examine the employee make-up of a long-standing company to prepare for shiftng demands from the workforce.  Due to the longevity of the company, many employees will be preparing for retirement around a similar time.  This analysis clearly defines how many of those employees, which positions they will be in, which will help address resource allocation and mentorship/training for more employees in similar positions to take over the responsibilites of the retirment eligible.


###Results

- Shown in the "retiring_titles.csv" that I created, many departments will actually maintain the leader ship which will reduce the need for restructuring short term.
[retirement_titles.csv](https://github.com/kittfranse/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/7782147/retirement_titles.csv)
- The large majority of retiring employees are senior engineering employees. This will define the recruitment strategy for the company going forward to focus heavily on this area.
- 1,500 employees are aviailbe to mentor as they prepare to wrap up their careers at the company.
- There are no managers eligible for the mentoring program, this is positive because many managers will still be with the company, however, the analysis should be repeated regularly.

###Additional Queries

Other queries that will provide a useful set of information are those that involve the percentage of employees in the department getting ready to leave. Although the flat number is useful, a larger department losing a smaller amount of people is going to be affected differently than a small department that is losing a similar number of people.  In a similar vein, figuring out which department managers are going to be retiring the soonest will be beneficial to find new employees that can take over those positions. It can shift a department focus to training rather than production for a short period of time to address those needs.
